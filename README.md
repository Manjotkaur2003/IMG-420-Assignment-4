# Assignment 4 ‚Äî Top-Down Game (Godot 4.4 Mono)

## Overview
A complete top-down 2D game developed using **Godot 4.4 Mono (C#)**.  
The player moves through a tile-based world, collects crystals, and avoids a pursuing enemy that uses navigation pathfinding.  
This project demonstrates the use of Godot‚Äôs **TileMap**, **NavigationAgent2D**, **AnimatedSprite2D**, **Particles2D**, and **AudioStreamPlayer** nodes with well-structured C# scripts.

---

## Controls
- **WASD / Arrow Keys:** Move the player  
- **ESC:** Quit the game

---

## Features Implemented
- ‚úÖ **Tile-based level design** using `TileMap` and `TileSet`
- ‚úÖ **Player movement** via `CharacterBody2D` and `move_and_slide()`
- ‚úÖ **Enemy pathfinding** implemented with `NavigationAgent2D`
- ‚úÖ **Collectibles (crystals)** using `Area2D` detection and scoring
- ‚úÖ **Particle effects** (`Sparkle.tscn`, `Explosion.tscn`) for visual feedback
- ‚úÖ **Audio feedback** (pickup, explosion, and looping background music)
- ‚úÖ **Win condition:** triggered when all crystals are collected
- ‚úÖ **Game Over condition:** triggered when the enemy reaches the player
- ‚úÖ **Auto scene reload** after win/loss via `Timer`
- ‚úÖ **UI** (`Label` in `CanvasLayer`) displays real-time score and status
- ‚úÖ **Clean, well-commented C# scripts**

##  How to Run
1. Open this folder in **Godot 4.4 (Mono version)**.  
2. Open the **Main scene** (`res://scenes/Main.tscn`).  
3. Press **Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è**.  
4. Move around using the controls to collect crystals and avoid the enemy.  
5. When all crystals are collected ‚Üí *‚Äúüéâ You Win!‚Äù*  
   If caught by the enemy ‚Üí *‚ÄúüíÄ Game Over üíÄ‚Äù*

## Game Logic Summary
| Mechanic | Node(s) Used | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Player Movement | `CharacterBody2D`, `AnimatedSprite2D` | Uses input vector and `MoveAndSlide()` |
| Enemy Navigation | `NavigationAgent2D`, `CharacterBody2D` | Continuously updates path to player |
| Collectibles | `Area2D`, `CollisionShape2D` | Increments score and triggers sparkle |
| Particle Effects | `Particles2D`, `GPUParticles2D` | Visual feedback for events |
| UI | `CanvasLayer`, `Label` | Displays score and status text |
| Audio | `AudioStreamPlayer` | Plays background and event sounds |
| Restart System | `Timer` node | Restarts scene after win/loss |

## Win Condition and Effects
- **Sparkle particles** play when collecting a crystal.  
- **Explosion particles** and *‚Äúüéâ You Win! üéâ‚Äù* appear after collecting all.  
- Scene restarts automatically after 3 seconds.

---

## Game Over Condition
- If the **enemy** reaches the player, an **explosion** plays and *‚ÄúüíÄ Game Over üíÄ‚Äù* appears.  
- The game restarts automatically after 3 seconds.

---

## Audio & Polish
- `pickup.wav` ‚Äî plays when collecting a crystal.  
- `explosion.wav` ‚Äî plays on win or game-over events.  
- `background.ogg` ‚Äî loops softly throughout gameplay.

## Technical Notes
This project was developed using **Godot 4.4 (Mono)** and C#.  
All scripts are organized under the `/scripts` directory, and each scene uses proper node hierarchies following best practices from the official documentation.
